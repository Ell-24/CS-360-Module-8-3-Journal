Module 8-3 Journal

The purpose of this project was to develop a simple android app that handles
logins and a grid view of the users updatable Inventory database, and also 
send SMS notifications to the user when conditions were met.

A login screen, Inventory screen and notification screen was necessary to 
meet these requriements. I kept each screen simplistic and followed 
industry standards. Each screen was easy to understand and easily 
navigable whilst keeping consistency with themeing and styling.

I utilized data bases and some widget tools like recycler view to properly
handle user inputs, and display data. I focused on one function at a time,
and spent a lot of time planning and drafting visual aids like wireframes.

I primarly utilized the android studio emulator to test my application. I 
focused on each function and a variety of specific conditions to ensure that
each functon that I added was wroking properly.

There was a lot i had to learn whilst developing this app and I ran into a
lot of road blocks mainly due to my inexperience with some of the subjects
that were covered within this project. With great sources and a lot of trial 
error and testing I was able to overcome my hurdles.

I specifically am proud of my login screen. I think I did a good job implementing
a good sign up method with proper error handling. And the validations utilizing 
the user data base works very well.
